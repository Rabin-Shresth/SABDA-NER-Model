\chapter{REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS}
\vspace{10pt}

As our project focuses on getting nepali text as input and analyzing its named entity and generating named entitys, it is assumed that the most of the 
requirements in our project is fulfilled by software requirements. This doesnâ€™t imply 
though that there is no use of hardware in our project. The requirement analysis of our 
project is presented below with descriptive subheadings
\section{Hardware Requirements}
\subsection{GPU}
Any decent computer can fulfil the hardware requirements for our project. The machine 
learning model was trained using Google Colab, which provides powerful processing 
capabilities from the cloud. However, if we were to train the model on our own, a 
powerful PC with a fast and robust CPU, higher RAM and storage, and an exceptional 
GPU or TPU would be necessary. This is due to the resource-intensive nature of 
machine learning, as it involves handling large amounts of data and requires significant 
training time. Furthermore, for deploying and performing our task, an UI was needed 
to display the output. Now, although, we are not at present planning to deploy it in order 
to receive calls, but if we were to receive calls from customers, then an even more 
powerful computer with superior processing and handling abilities would be required 
and this depends on the scale and reach of the company implementing our technology 
itself.
\section{Software Requirements}
Our project is almost totally software based. The code was written in Python 
programming language. Using Python, machine learning can be done easily, and 
frameworks like TensorFlow can be used for deep learning. To train the machine 
learning model, Google Colab, which is a free, cloud based service is used that gives 
us access to the GPU and CPU from the cloud. The testing of the model can be obtained 
in the software such as PyCharm, which is a Python IDE. And also Visual Studio Code 
was used to test the machine learning model and produce different results.
\subsection{Python}
Python is one of the most popular programming language in the world. It is a language 
that can be used easily for machine learning. Python offers us with a wealth of libraries 
and frameworks that support the development and deployment of machine learning 
models. The simplicity and readability of Python, along with its ability to handle 
numerical computations and data manipulation, make it well suited for implementing 
machine learning algorithms. Popular libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and 
Scikit-learn provide a range of tools for tasks such as deep learning, computer vision, 
and natural language processing. With its active community and growing industry 
demand for machine learning expertise, Python is a valuable skill for anyone interested 
in the field. Thus without a doubt, python is the go to language for us in this project.
\subsection{Google-Colab}
Google Colab is a free online platform for machine learning and data science research. 
It provides access to a Jupyter Notebook environment, running in the cloud, with free 
access to GPUs and TPUs (Tensor Processing Units) for acceleration. This makes it 
easy for data scientists and researchers to develop and run large scale machine learning 
experiments and analyze complex data sets. Google Colab also provides integration 
with Google Drive, making it simple to save and share notebooks, as well as to import 
and export data. The platform supports popular machine learning libraries such as 
TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn, and provides a web-based interface for 
developing and executing code. With its ease of use, powerful computing resources, 
and seamless integration with other Google services, Google Colab has become a 
popular choice for data scientists and researchers.

\subsection{Javascript}
To create dynamic and interactive websites, JavaScript plays a pivotal role alongside HTML and CSS. HTML establishes the structure of the webpage, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, and images. CSS, on the other hand, styles the layout, ensuring a visually appealing presentation. JavaScript, a client-side scripting language, breathes life into the static structure and styling. It enables real-time interactions and responsiveness by allowing the manipulation of HTML elements and dynamically updating content. With JavaScript, developers can implement features such as form validation, image sliders, and responsive navigation menus. By seamlessly integrating these three technologies, web developers can craft engaging and user-friendly websites that not only convey information but also provide an immersive and interactive user experience.
